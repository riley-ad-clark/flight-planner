## Prerequisites
As with other projects, this web app requires a bit of set up to get started, see the applications below to ensure you are ready to begin.

- <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition</a>, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16">SQL Server Management Studio</a>

## Setup
The following steps are meant to ensure the user experience is as seamless as possible, if there are any errors, or missing steps you have encountered that _are not_ covered, please submit a pull request!

- **I) Ensure that Visual Studio has the correct components installed. To do so, follow the steps below:**
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Assuming a <b>Windows</b> machine is being used:</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Open Control Panel > Uninstall a program > Locate 'Microsoft Visual Studio Installer' > Right click > Select change</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/01b341d2-e202-4d88-832b-a2bcc7a9a95a" height="50%" width="50%"></div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Select "Modify" > Tick the "ASP.NET and web development" box > see "Individual Components" > Select all boxes > Install </div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/3b0eba64-0a7a-449a-8240-66dc14bda17f" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
&nbsp;

- **II) Launch Visual Studio, and select "Clone a repository", and paste the link to this GitHub repo in the "Repository Location" section**
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/dbb8ac0c-c784-434a-83fd-4fd3ee673371" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
</div>
&nbsp;

- **III) Once loaded, double click "FlightPlanner.sln" (found in the solution explorer on the right) and ensure you can see the following screen:**
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/2da2d43a-601c-45eb-993a-cd242f72b929" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
&nbsp;

- **IV) From this screen, select the following:**
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Tools (from the top menu) > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console, this should open a new console</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/9a1681aa-6cc3-401d-a97b-32e40cd3463e" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
&nbsp;

- **V) Enter the following code in the console:**
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><code>PM> add-migration migration01 -Context ApplicationDbContext</code></div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Once the build has succeeded, enter the following:</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><code>PM> Update-Database â€“Verbose -Context ApplicationDbContext</code></div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">In short, this project uses a "code first" approach in terms of data storage. In doing so, we must manually connect to our local database, this is what the code above does.</div>
&nbsp;

## On the subject of databases...

If you would like to see your database update in real time, following these steps:

- **I) Open SQL Server Management Studio, and enter the following information once prompted to connect to a DB:**
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/eb33b3e9-dd78-47a0-9989-a9e7c6cecafb" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">This will connect you to the previously mentioned database that we initialized earlier!</div>
&nbsp;

- **II) Once connected, open the folders found in the image below to access your tables!**
&nbsp;
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/riley-ad-clark/flight-planner/assets/144390085/42571e7a-b504-403d-bd8e-063054826b8f" height="25%" width="25%"></div>
</div>

## Application Instructions
<br>
<div align="center">As of March 20th, 2024, this application is an "admin view", meaning you have access to anything an administrator would have access to (I.E, CRUD operations for vital information for the application), there is a plan on the way to implement a seperate user view, so stay tuned ;)</div>
<br>
<div align="center">To use this application, browse around! Add some fictional airports, book some flights, delete whatever you may like! There is plenty to do, and we always welcome you to test, and report back with any bugs you may find.</div>
